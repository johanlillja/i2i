# What is i2i

i2i is an application written in MATLAB for processing of mass spectrometry imaging data sets. The application
can be run targeted or untargeted data analysis. It currently supports .mzML files, 
we recomend Proteowizard MSConvert (https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/) or ThermoRawFileParserGUI (https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParserGUI)

i2i was made to handle complex MSI experiments fast and convenient from an intuitive GUI,
some features includes:
* Usage of arbitrarily complex MS experiments (MSn, HCD, SIM, Multiplexing, ...)
* Alignment of individual line scans based on instrument duty cycle
* Perform region of interest analysis 
* Generate high quality figures
* Process data fast

# Requirements

The application is developed with MATLAB 2022a, please use this version when you test the application. There might be conflicts when trying to run the
code with other verisons of MATLAB.
After downloading the source code you need to add the whole folder to path, this is easily done by right clicking on the folder.
You also need the image processing toolbox and the parallel computing toolbox in MATLAB. 

# Description of the code

The live script 'Basic_functional_description.mlx' in the source folder is a live script that shows the basic structure of the code. 
If the source code has been added to path and all required packages are installed it can be executed.
The live script does not have all quality of life features available in the compiled application.
